# apps-script
Script that generates Google Forms from a Google Sheet.

The original creator of this script is Jason Jurotich. I took what he created and made it a bit more complete, though, it's not **ALL** the way complete. 

**The link to the spreadsheet is:** 
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16zKEd5tsRBuyvxGLJorXyBHQqPkePwOWuDGQbFJhW4c/edit?usp=sharing

Make a copy of it and paste the script in.
